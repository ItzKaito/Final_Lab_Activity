# How to Set Up and Run the Savings and Shopping Tracker Project

Prerequisites:

    - Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher installed on your system.

    - A Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) for easy development and running of the project.


# Steps to Set Up:


1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK):

        - Download and install the JDK from the official Oracle website or use an open-source distribution like OpenJDK.

        - Ensure the JDK is properly set up by running java -version in the command line to verify the installation.


2. Download or Clone the Project:

        - If the project is stored in a repository (e.g., GitHub), clone it to your local machine using a Git client or download the zip file.

        - If you have the project files, ensure they are in a directory on your computer.


3. Open the Project in an IDE:

        - Open your chosen Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).

        - If using IntelliJ IDEA, select File > Open and navigate to the folder where the project is stored, then open it.

        - If using Eclipse, select File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace, then browse to the project folder.


4. Check for Missing Libraries:

       - Ensure you have JOptionPane available (it's part of the standard Java library, so it should already be available in the JDK). No additional libraries are required for this project.


5. Compile the Code:

        - In your IDE, compile the code by selecting the Build or Compile option, usually found in the menu or toolbar.


6. Run the Program:

        - Locate the SavingsAndShoppingTracker class (or the main class of the project).

        - Click the Run button (usually represented by a green play button in your IDE).

        - The program should start, and the main menu will be displayed in a dialog box.


7. Interact with the Program:

        -Follow the on-screen prompts in the JOptionPane dialog boxes to interact with the program. You can deposit money, view your balance, shop for items, and manage your shopping cart.
